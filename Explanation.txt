Step 1 :

   To access the Python library we will install it.

   Command : pip install requests


Step 2 :

   Now we will import the package into our python script.

   Command : import requests


   By doing so we have imported the library using the command import requests.


Step 3 :

  city = input('input the city name')     -----------> Take the input from the user for the city he wish to forecast the weather.
  print(city)

  print('Displaying Weather report for: ' + city)


Step 4 :


  Now ww will define a URL,make use of format to pass city as a parameter here.

  url = 'https://wttr.in/{}'.format(city)

Step 5 :

  res = requests.get(url)    ------> here will make use of our requests module

Step 6 :

  Our resultant data is stored in res. So we will make use of the text method to extract the weather details.

  print(res.text)
